# Citibike Data Analysis

## Project Overview
 Citibike,[check](https://citibikenyc.com/how-it-works) the largest bike-share program in the United States, with 20,000 bikes and over 1,300 pick-up stations across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Jersey City. As stated on their website, the service was designed for quick trips with convenience in mind, offering a fun and affordable way to get around town. Users can sign up for annual membership, or buy a short-term pass through the Citi Bike app. Once theyâ€™ve joined, they simply locate a nearby bike, ride around as they please, and return it to a nearby station once theyâ€™re done ðŸš´
Like most organizations, Citi Bike is constantly looking for ways to improve their business model and provide an even better experience for their customers.This project is to analyze data collected by Citi Bike  and help key stakeholders to make smart, data-driven decisions based on the insights to be uncover.Hereâ€™s what iâ€™ll seek to investigate:

## Findings
- Grove St Path, Exchange Place, Sip Ave, Hamilton Park, & Morris Canal are one of the most popular pick up locations
- The primary demographic engaging with Citi Bike consists of individuals aged 35 to 44, who exhibit the highest frequency of bike rentals. Additionally, subscribers demonstrate heightened activity levels on Wednesdays. Contrastingly, new users tend to engage more on weekends.

## Recommendations
- Install more bikes to the most popular pick up areas
- Capitalize on the popularity of bike rentals among individuals aged 35 to 44 by tailoring marketing campaigns to appeal specifically to this demographic. Highlight features such as convenience, health benefits, and environmental sustainability to attract and retain this age group.
- Recognizing heightened activity levels among subscribers on Wednesdays, consider introducing special promotions or discounts for subscribers who utilize Citi Bike services on this day. This targeted approach can further encourage loyalty and consistent engagement.
